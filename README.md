# FirstProp

A "First Prop" flutter project for remote study purposes

## Getting Started

Here is our basic concept for our current flutter project:

Main Layer:
  - Domain Layer - Save any Entities, Usecases, Repository (As Interface)
  - Data Layer - Model (Use to transform data<->object), Datasources(Api connection / local ), Repository Implementation 
  - Presentation Layer - App State, UI, Pages/widgets
